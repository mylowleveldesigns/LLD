Let's say we have an object O with property f1, and after some time we need to add another property f2 on it.
Instead of adding f2 on the base object, we will decorate it on another extension of base class.
Similarly for f3, f4, f4 ... fn

This save us from something called class explosion

Eg Base class car

F1 -> AC
F2 -> SterosSystem
F3 -> powerstearing

There can be combinatorics of these properties as well .
So, that's when decorator pattern comes into picture.
